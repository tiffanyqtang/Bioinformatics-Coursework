# 🧬 Next Generation Sequencing Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for the **Next Generation Sequencing** class. Most of the work for this course is done on **NYU's High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster**, but this repository organizes my **weekly assignments**, primarily containing:

- **SBATCH scripts** 🖥️ for submitting jobs to the HPC  
- **R scripts** 📊 for data analysis and visualization  

Each week's directory corresponds to a different assignment.

## 🚀 Notes
Since most of the heavy computation is performed on NYU's HPC, this repository mainly tracks scripts rather than large data files or output logs.
